/**
 * A [StateProcessor] which processes jobs sent to it sequentially, prioritizing state reducers over actions.
 *
 * This implementation is based on the [select] statement rather than an [kotlinx.coroutines.channels.actor].
 * Additionally, it supports startup under a lazy mode to facilitate testing. If it is created under lazy mode, it
 * does not begin processing jobs sent to it until the [start] method is called.
 *
 * Benchmarks suggest that this implementation is about 50% faster than the Actors based implementation.
 *
 * @param shouldStartImmediately if true, jobs sent to this processor begin processing immediately after creation, or
 * only after [start] is called otherwise
 * @param stateHolder the [StateHolder] where this processor can store and read the current state
 * @param logger a [Logger] to log miscellaneous information
 * @param coroutineContext The [CoroutineContext] under which this processor will execute jobs sent to it
